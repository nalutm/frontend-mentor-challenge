## The challenges

### 3-column preview card component

My first challenge was to build out this [3-column preview card component](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/3column-preview-card-component-pH92eAR2-) and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

The users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for interactive elements
